Repository for the assignment on duplicate detection for the Computer Science and Business Analytics course. In this assignment we will create a scalable duplicate detection method that finds duplicates from the product title.
First, the data is cleaned. Secondly, we construct modelwords from the product titles, and from these modelwords we create binary vectors. Then, a signature matrix is created by using minhashing, which is the input voor Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). The signature matrix is divided in b bands, each containing r rows. The products in every band are compared and assigned to buckets using a hashfunction. Next, the candidate pairs are constructed and clustered using average linkage hierachical clustering algorithm.  In total 5 boostraps are performed. As a evaluation measure we use Pair Quality (PQ), Pair Completeness (PC), F1-measure and F1*-measure.
